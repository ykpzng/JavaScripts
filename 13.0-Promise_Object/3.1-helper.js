/*
* checkInventory() builds on the logic of the
* orderSunglasses() function you wrote in a previous
* exercise.
*
* checkInventory() takes in an array representing an
* order and returns a promise.
*
* If every item in the order is in stock, that promise
* resolves with the value "Thank you. Your order was
* successful."
*
* Otherwise, the promise rejects with the value "We're
* sorry. Your order could not be completed because some
* items are sold out".
*
* We used setTimeout() to ensure that the
* checkInventory() promise settles asynchronously.
