/* Intro:
 * checkInventory() expects an order argument and returns 
 * a promise. If there are enough items in stock to fill 
 * the order, the promise will resolve to an array. 
 * The first element in the resolved value array will be 
 * the same order and the second element will be the 
 * total cost of the order as a number.
 * 
 * processPayment() expects an array argument with the 
 * order as the first element and the purchase total as 
 * the second. This function returns a promise. If there 
 * is a large enough balance on the giftcard associated 
 * with the order, it will resolve to an array. The first 
 * element in the resolved value array will be the same 
 * order and the second element will be a tracking number.
 * 
 * shipOrder() expects an array argument with the order 
 * as the first element and a tracking number as the 
 * second. It returns a promise which resolves to a 
 * string confirming the order has shipped.
